When I navigated to csfr_form.php and clicked submit it logged me into csfr_action.php 
as the session variable and the hidden confirmation value matched. But when I navigated to csfr.html
and clicked submit I was redirected to the csfr_action.php page but didnt log me in as the session variable is non-existant
in csfr.html.
